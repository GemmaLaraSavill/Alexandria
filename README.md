A book list and barcode scanner app.
Developed as part of my [Android Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree) at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree).
Was given the starter code to debug and improve.

1. Integrated barcode scanning from the camera preview using [Android Vision API](https://developers.google.com/vision/barcodes-overview). I have used code from sample at https://github.com/googlesamples/android-vision
2. Added accessibility content descriptions to layouts. Tested with TalkBack.
3. Added L2R support.
4. Corrected errors.
5. Changed UI: changed Navigation Fragment for NavigationView with header and menu. Added CardViews and GridLayout. Material Design theme.

## Installation

Clone the code and import it as a project into [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/intl/es/tools/studio/index.html)
